## Introduction
Welcome to my Milestone Project 3. Happer Camper is a website that allows users to find campsites and share their own opinions of campsites. The site allows users to search for campsite reviews, submit their own reviews, and edit and delete reviews they have created. In addition, the admin account enables the admin user to create, edit and delete reviews and locations. Furthermore, users can submit a message to the site creator via the contact form, which uses the EmailJS API.
